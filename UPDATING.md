# Updating From SubsDCC

All your data will be deleted. 

The new app requires **Storage** permissions.

This allows the app to get info for a download progress notification

## Termux Commands

After allowing storage permissions, open the app.

This will create a file in Download folder called commands.txt

Open the file, then copy and paste #2 and #3 into Termux.

The app **WILL NOT** work without doing these steps

# If you deleted Termux

You have to copy and paste #1 before the other two commands
